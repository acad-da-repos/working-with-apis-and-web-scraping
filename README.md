# Working with APIs and Web Scraping Assignment

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will practice fetching data from an API and scraping data from a website. These are valuable skills for acquiring data from the web.

## Instructions

1.  Open the `assignment.py` file.
2.  You will find two function definitions: `get_data_from_api(url)` and `scrape_data_from_website(url)`.
3.  Your task is to implement these functions to fetch data from the given URLs.
    *   For the API, you will need to make a GET request and parse the JSON response.
    *   For web scraping, you will need to use a library like BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract the desired data.

## Further Exploration (Optional)

*   How can you handle different HTTP status codes when making API requests?
*   Explore other web scraping libraries in Python, such as Scrapy or Selenium.
*   How can you handle websites that use JavaScript to load data dynamically?
